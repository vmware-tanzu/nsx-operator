// ServiceMediator We use mediator pattern to wrap all the services,

// transparently to the caller, for example, in other packages, we can use ServiceMediator.GetVPCsByNamespace directly.
// In startCRDController function, we register the CRDService to the ServiceMediator, since only one controller writes to
// its own store and other controllers read from the store, so we don't need lock here.

// Currently, we only support one vpc per namespace, but we may support multiple vpcs per namespace in the future,
// so we return a slice of VPCInfo.
